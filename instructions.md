# Instructions

This is a to-do app project, meant to be integrated with claude for more naturalistic workflows. 

The app will need to run with a GUI on mac desktop, showing the current list of to-dos in a calm, ordered list. 

The app should use naturalistic language, helping a user prioritize. 

The app should have persistent memory to maintain todos over multiple days

## Interface

The User interface should be calm, with large, readable text that gently flows upward message by message, fading into history (though it should remain scrollable)

The UI should allow both voice and text input, and show the conversation inputs as well as the response from the app. 

## Development Guidelines

Assume that things like api keys will be provided to you over the course of development. 

Keep things light and easily readable. 

Ask 2-3 questions after every prompt during code generation.

Stand up a git project and use the gh command to commit to github remotely.
